### Skills I Have
I am web designer and developer, python coder and financial market trader/invesetor. My goal with every coding and development project I work on is to provide the best solution to whatever problem is needing to be solved. From the inital design and planning stage all the way to the final product delivery, I am focused on solving problems the best way possible that the end user is readily able to use for their business or personal growth. Aside from my coding and development skills, which are outlined below I am well versed and experienced in data analysis, particulary of macro and micro economic and company data. This data analysis I use o na daily basis to make trading and investment decisions using my own funds.

 <summary><h3> Andrei's Coding Story</h3></summary>
   I have always been interested and facinated with computers, computer coding and anything electronic. So when I found out I could learn how to code on my own and do things like build computers, I was excited and hooked. For me my learning journey  started way back when I was a pre-teen learning to code in HTML and CSS at a local college. The class only lasted a few days but it opened me up to a world of new opportunities and interests. From there I have throughout the years coded on my own. Mostly just personal use stuff and for practice to build and keep my skills. I also attended university for a time where I learned even more about coding and computer science and related fields. That's where I started to use Python in particular and loved every minute of it. This then lead me to at least dipping my toes into many other languages and expanding on a few of those including SQL and MQL4 (a C based language used to code trading bots as I also started my jounrey as a trader throughout this time; though much later). Throughout my learning and usage of the coding skills I have, I expanded to the design side of things and have now designed several test and practice apps and websites using design and illustration software. I enjoy (almost) every minute of coding. And those times I don't enjoy it (cause I've been stuck on a problem for who knows how long) I always enjoy the learning and discovery process of finding new and better ways of solving problems and learning even more as I go along.
