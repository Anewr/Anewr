### Skills I Have
I am web designer and developer, python coder and financial market trader/invesetor. My goal with every coding and development project I work on is to provide the best solution to whatever problem is needing to be solved. From the inital design and planning stage all the way to the final product delivery, I am focused on solving problems the best way possible that the end user is readily able to use for their business or personal growth. Aside from my coding and development skills, which are outlined below I am well versed and experienced in data analysis, particulary of macro and micro economic and company data. This data analysis I use o na daily basis to make trading and investment decisions using my own funds.
